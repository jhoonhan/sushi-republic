# Sushi Republic Greensboro, NC
A Static Website for Local Korean Restaurant that was developed in 2015

This is a static HTML/CSS website that I put together back in 2017.
This was my thrid website after just learning HTML/CSS which means BAD coding!
I plan to come back and clean them up with semantic HTML and BEM CSS convention.
